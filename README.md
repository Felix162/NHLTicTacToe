# Rules
The rules are simple, it's the Tic Tac Toe game as you know it with a little added twist to test your knowledge of the NHL and its history.
In order to place your mark in an empty square, you have to correctly guess an NHL player who once played for the 2 teams associated with the selected empty square.
Each column and each row of the 3x3 grid is associated with an NHL team.
